Nodejs
=============
### What's Nodejs?

- Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications

- Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux with no changes

### Why?

- Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency.

- Using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events that makes it lightweight and efficient

- Commonly used for real-time applications due to its asynchronous nature.

- Perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices

### How?

-  Node.js internally uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript

-  Node.js contains a built-in asynchronous I/O library for file, socket, and HTTP communication, which allows applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.

- Node.js registers itself with the operating system, so that it is notified when a connection is made. When a connection is made, the operating system will issue a callback. Within the Node.js runtime, each connection is a small heap allocation.
